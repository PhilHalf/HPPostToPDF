# HPPostToPDF
Wordpress Post to PDF converter

# Usage
Add querystring parameter to the URL ?p2p_output=1 to save a PDF



# Plans
This plugin has been created to support a specific requirement for saving Wordpress posts / pages as a PDF document.
I am planning on extending this further to provide options for debugging (e.g. viewing the markup before it's exported to PDF) and providing custom templates for different post types / page templates.
